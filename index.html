          Socially anxious high school student Shoko Komi’s greatest dream is to
          make some friends, but everyone at school mistakes her crippling
          social anxiety for cool reserve! With the whole student body keeping
          their distance and Komi unable to utter a single word, friendship
          might be forever beyond her reach.

          Timid Tadano is a total wallflower, and that’s just the way he likes
          it. But all that changes when he finds himself alone in a classroom on
          the first day of high school with the legendary Komi. He quickly
          realizes she isn’t aloof—she’s just super awkward. Now he’s made it
          his mission to help her on her quest to make 100 friends!
